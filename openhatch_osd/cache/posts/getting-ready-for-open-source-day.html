<p>Welcome to OpenHatch and Grace Hopper's Open Source Day 2015. While we will be spending only a few
hours together in Houston, I hope that you will find the time valuable and you will share your
knowledge and experience with others.</p>
<p>I find contributing to open source as a great way to empower others to solve real world problems.
I am so pleased that Open Source Day 2015's theme is Humanitarian Open Source.</p>
