Welcome
-------

Welcome to Open Source Day with OpenHatch at the Grace Hopper Celebration.

I'm so pleased to be sharing my interest in open source and humanity with you. While we will be
spending only a few hours together in Houston, I hope that you will find the time
valuable. In the days and months after Grace Hopper, I hope that many of you will share your
knowledge and experience with others.

On a personal note, I find contributing to open source as a great way to empower others to solve
real world problems. I am so pleased that Open Source Day 2015's theme focuses on
Humanitarian Open Source.

Attendees
---------

Grace Hopper is an exciting event to attend. There's much to see and do as well as get ready for
the week. I have purposefully left the pre-workshop requirements minimal.

If you have a personal laptop, please do bring it to the workshop. I recognize that not everyone
may be bringing a computer and let me put your mind at ease if that is the case. Everyone will be
able to participate and learn from the workshop.

Pre-event preparation (if your time permits): you may wish to create a *GitHub* account and install
the command line version of git for your system.

Mentors
-------

Thank you for sharing your time and love of computer science. Other than perhaps skimming this
website, installing git on your laptop and having an editor that you feel comfortable using, you
do not need to do any prior preparation. Please bring your patience and enthusiasm too.

Projects
--------

* OpenHatch website
* Systers Volunteer Management System
* "To be named and created" Open Source Day 2015 Pay-It-Forward Project

Thank you

Please take a moment during the entire conference to thank the many volunteers and organizers.
Thank you to the Hoppers too!

Safe travels, and I'm looking forward to seeing you in a few days.
