Welcome to OpenHatch and Grace Hopper's Open Source Day 2015
============================================================

While we will be spending only a few hours together in Houston, I hope that you will find the time
valuable. In the days and months after Grace Hopper, I hope that many of you will share your
knowledge and experience with others.

On a personal note, I find contributing to open source as a great way to empower others to solve
real world problems. I am so pleased that Open Source Day 2015's theme focuses on
Humanitarian Open Source.


Attendees
---------

We're all busy and Grace Hopper is an exciting event to attend. If you have a personal laptop,
please do bring it to the workshop. I recognize that not everyone may be bringing a computer, no
worries as you will still be able to participate and learn from the workshop.

Mentors
-------

Thank you for sharing your time and love of computer science. Other than perhaps skimming this
website, installing git on your laptop and having an editor that you feel comfortable using. Please
bring your patience and enthusiasm too.

Projects
--------

* OpenHatch website
* Systers Volunteer Management System
* "To be named and created" Open Source Day 2015 Pay-It-Forward Project

Thank you
---------

Please take a moment during the entire conference to thank the many volunteers and organizers.
Thank you to the Hoppers too!
